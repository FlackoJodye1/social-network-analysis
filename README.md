# Data Files

The data files contain data from derStandard.at and can be found on TUWEL.
Before running the code, dowload all data available at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wR5MG_6e9N2zGjDVUyxawp_wJ1NSilE-) and place them into the folder data/raw, that you can find [here](/data/)

## Setup

The make_user.py file contains a script that can be run to create the user.csv file in the ./data/processed directory.
This csv file is used in the follows.ipynb file. Since we already included this file in our ./data directory it is not necessary to do so again. 

## Following-Relationship

All figures and results are present in the notebook.
**filename:** follows.ipynb

## Postings

All results are present in the notebook.
**filename:** postings.ipynb

## Votes

All results are present in the notebook.
**filename:** votes.ipynb

## Figures

The graphs and illustration created in the follows.ipynb file are saved by default into the ./figures directory.
We did not upload them, so they have to be created by running the notebook.
